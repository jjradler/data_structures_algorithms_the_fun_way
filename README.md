# data_structures_algorithms_the_fun_way
Workthrough of examples, data structure constructions, and problems from Kubica's Data Structures &amp; Algorithms The Fun Way.

## Usage: 

This repository is primarily for my own reference and use. However, if you find it helpful to look through my implementations from the book, as well as my own extensions that I added for funsies, here is the basic structure for the information in this repository. 

* Each chapter has its own directory. There may be subdirectories for topics within these directories.  
* Each chapter contains a `NOTES.md` file that contains at least the high-level overview and probably my own digest and pseudocode based on Kubica’s book. 
* Each chapter will contain a set of source and header files. I am currently compiling these with `g++` on an Apple Silicon Macbook and they all seem to work if you want to play with them. 
* There aren’t any `Makefiles` at this point because… this isn’t meant to be a library or deployable code repository. It’s a reference and set of corresponding listings in `C++` that can be compiled and explored as standalone programs on the CLI.
